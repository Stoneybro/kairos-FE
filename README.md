# KAIROS ‚Äì A discipline & accountability platform powered by smart accounts  

## Overview  
**KAIROS** is an accountability and discipline platform built on programmable smart wallets powered by **Account Abstraction**.  

The core idea is simple: **users collateralize their goals with their own money.**  

- When a user creates a task, they lock funds into a smart wallet.  
- If the task is completed, the funds are returned.  
- If the task is not completed, the funds are either **delayed** for a set period or **redirected** to an accountability partner chosen by the user.  

This mechanism combines **incentives** and **consequences**, helping users stay consistent with their goals in ways traditional task managers and to-do apps cannot.

## Why KAIROS?  
Modern productivity tools often fail because they lack real stakes.  

KAIROS introduces **skin in the game**, ensuring goals are backed by tangible commitment. Whether you‚Äôre learning a new skill, managing a packed schedule, or simply building better habits, KAIROS helps you stay accountable.
